# Branch (a,b) Elimination — v19

Elimination of GGHV normal form (2) [branch (a,b)] in the degree-(8,28) case of the
two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture, with a Lean 4 machine-checked proof of the
m = 7 top-layer classification (Proposition 6.1).

v19 implements the ten recommendations of the independent final blind review
received 2026-09-28 (no fatal flaw found in the b_{12,24}=0 chain): the main
theorem now concludes only b_{12,24}=0 (a_{8,16}=0 is an independent
rigidity corollary), the proof is organized around four certificates, the
35-minor span argument and the characteristic-zero transfer are explicit,
and the obstruction script emits a machine-readable K5 rank certificate.
See `CHANGES_v19.md` for the full list. The v18 tree is in the git history
(commit 42cbf03); it was kept at the repository root as `branch_ab_v18/` until
2026-09-30.

**Two identical copies.** This package is in the repository twice, with identical
contents:
- `branch_ab_v19/` at the repository root, the path that the Zenodo record
  10.5281/zenodo.23023490 cites;
- `JC2D-branches_a_b_c_unified/branches_a_b/`.

The 2026-10-05 revision adds the a₈,₁₆ certificate, the Lean m = 3, 5
classifications and the B2.2 resolution. See `CHANGES_v19.md` §15.
The 2026-10-07 revision adds the Lean proof of Corollary 1.2 (a₈,₁₆ = 0) and
Remark 8.8 (lower-edge rigidity), `lean/Jacobian/A816/`. See `CHANGES_v19.md` §16.

Elimination of GGHV normal form (2) [branch (a,b)] in the degree-(8,28) case of the
two-dimensional Jacobian conjecture, with a Lean 4 machine-checked proof of the
m = 7 top-layer classification (Proposition 6.1).

## What this is

For polynomials P, Q ∈ L[x,y] over a field L of characteristic 0 in GGHV normal
form (2) with [P,Q] = λx², λ ≠ 0, there is **no solution**. The Lean formalization
proves, independently of GGHV Proposition 4.3:

- `chartClassification_holds`: every solution of the 17-equation normalized chart
  (`ChartClassification L`) is one of the five K₅-conjugate points (m = 7 case of
  Proposition 6.1), kernel-checked, depending only on `propext`,
  `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`.
- `main_theorem`: the NewtonNF2 form of Theorem 1.1 with no remaining hypothesis,
  kernel-checked on the standard axioms only.
- `lower_edge_rigidity` (2026-10-07): under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, every
  coefficient of P and Q off the top edges vanishes except the constant terms, so
  a₈,₁₆ = 0 (`a816_eq_zero`, Corollary 1.2) and P = P₂ + const, Q = Q₃ + const
  (Remark 8.8); `main_theorem_lower_edge` refutes NewtonNF2 through the vertex
  (8,16) alone. Same three axioms.

Conditional on GGHV Proposition 4.3, this eliminates branch (a,b). Branch (c)
(normal form (1)) is **not** addressed and remains open, as does the full
planar Jacobian conjecture.

## Reproduction

```bash
cd lean
lake exe cache get                              # fetch Mathlib oleans
LEAN_NUM_THREADS=1 bash verify_branch_ab_lean.sh  # full build + 66-theorem axiom audit
CONTROLS_JOBS=1 bash controls.sh                  # 14/14 as expected: 3 unmodified ACCEPT, 9 perturbed REJECT (expected Lean error), 2 sorry copies flagged
CONTROLS_JOBS=1 bash controls_a816.sh             # 9/9 as expected for Jacobian/A816: 2 ACCEPT, 6 REJECT, 1 sorry copy flagged
bash certgen/check_regeneration.sh                # byte-identical regeneration, plus the Jacobian/A816 statement check
```

Quick checks (no Lean needed):

```bash
python3 lean/certgen/chartproof/independent_check.py   # 111/111 identities over Z (~2 s)
python3 lean/certgen/chartproof/saturation_check.py     # saturation over Q (needs Singular)
```

## Scope and provenance

- The main theorem's Lean proof uses the m = 7 chart classification. The
  m = 3 and m = 5 chart classifications are kernel-checked separately
  (`lean/Jacobian/B26*`, 2026-10-05); the main theorem does not use them.
  The degree-35 eliminant, the explicit a₈,₁₆ certificate of
  `scripts/a816_certificate/` (an independent second proof of Corollary 1.2;
  the corollary itself is kernel-checked since 2026-10-07), and GGHV
  Proposition 4.3 are outside the Lean formalization (see
  `lean/CLASSIFICATION_STATUS.md` and paper §1.3 "Logical status").
- Nothing here claims resolution of the (8,28) case or the Jacobian conjecture.

## Status
