## What the paper is

The branch-(c) elimination worked out **symbolically** (Lean 4: 790 modules, 600
kernel-checked reflective identities, no `sorry`/`axiom`/`native_decide`,
`#print axioms` = propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound) and **numerically**
(exact K5 certificate on the t1=0 stratum; fixed-degree Macaulay rank lemma at
W=24, two primes, two independent implementations, negative controls).

It follows the format of the branch-(a,b) elimination paper
(`../branches_a_b/paper/branch_ab_elimination_v3.tex`) exactly: same document
class and layout, Fira Sans text with Fira Math symbols and Fira Mono code,
theorem/lemma/definition environments, Lean code listings, four finished
vector figures (regenerable from the checked-in Python scripts), epistemic-grade
claim registry, computational archive appendix, and AI-disclosure section.

## Status

- The Lean-checked part (descent, t1=0 stratum) is grade A.
- The whole-chart rank computation is proved outside Lean (grade B) under the
  stated computational premises; the false reduction lemma is retracted and
  replaced by the rank lemma (§5.9 of the guide, §10 of the paper).
- The degree-19 rigidity lemma's parity-constrained Davenport–Stothers step is
  supplied by an external certified point (grade B), not formalized in Lean
  (§3.2 of the paper).
- This is **not** a proof of the planar Jacobian conjecture and does not cover
  other GGHV cases (see §12 of the paper, "what is not claimed").

Requires: Fira Sans, Fira Sans Italic/Bold, Fira Mono, Fira Math (OpenType).
Font discipline (Brandon 2026-10-01): Fira ONLY — Fira Sans (text), Fira Mono
(code), Fira Math (math, with `FakeBold=0.3`). Latin Modern Math is forbidden
everywhere, including inside `tabular` environments. Noto fonts are not used.
The build is verified: exit 0 on all three passes, zero overfull boxes, zero
undefined references/citations, 18 pages, `pdffonts` shows only Fira families.
